# Android_Beginner_Football_Stats_App

This is a Score keeper app that keeps track of scores and other statistics in a football match such as fouls, corner-kicks, yellow-cards, etc.
The app is divided into two columns, one for each team.
Each column contains multiple buttons that keep track of a particular metric in the football match.
Also, there is a "Reset" button, that clears all previous statistics for a fresh start.
"The code adheres to all of the following best practices:

Text sizes are defined in sp
Lengths are defined in dp
Padding and margin is used appropriately, such that the views are not crammed up against each other."
